## Getting Started with Micro Development Kit
- Connect your MicroFlex MCU board with Kit as shown below,

  <img src="https://github.com/sbcshop/Micro_Development_Kit_Software/blob/main/images/MicroMCU_breadboardkit.png" width="337" height="280">

- Now follow corresponding steps to setup your board to use with MicroPython or Arduino =>
   - [MicroPython Setup for MicroFlex MCU ](https://github.com/sbcshop/MicroFlex_MCU_Software/tree/main/MicroFlex%20with%20Micropython)
   - [Arduino Setup for MicroFlex MCU](https://github.com/sbcshop/MicroFlex_MCU_Software/tree/main/MicroFlex%20with%20Arduino%20IDE)
- When particular MicroFlex MCU board connected on Dev kit check corresponding GPIOs mapped over physical pins.
